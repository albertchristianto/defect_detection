# Defect Detection Application

This is the application and an effort of building a CI/CD project for defect detection system. The main goal for this application are:
1. Do defect detection inference with deep learning method {Done}
2. Do annotation for defect detection dataset
3. Train a new deep learning network to update the accuracy of the defect detection system
4. Easy for doing research and deploying the research product
5. Friendly user interface

The project is built using Python and C++. The C++ serves as a backend for the Python GUI.
