# ImageClassifier
This repository is a re-implementation of the image classification problems using deep learning. You can train an image classifier model using your custom dataset with it. Here are some steps for you:
1. Prepare and organize your dataset.
2. Copy two python files in here into A.
3. Run these two python files from A to generate B and C.
4. Execute this command to train your model 
5. Execute this command to test your model 
6. Execute this command to use your model on a single image
7. Execute this command to convert a PyTorch weights format to an Onnx weights format
8. Execute this command to check the numbers of the model's training parameters
